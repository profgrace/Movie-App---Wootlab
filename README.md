# Wootlab

This is for a Movie collection mobile app. Users will be able to view all the movies on the Trails app, and also add to or from from their favorites collection. In addition, users will be able to view details of a movie such as the movie genre, its plot summary and even cast.

During my design process, I had to put myself in the shoes of the user and also do some research. Therefore, I was able to deduce that users love to see a trailer of the movie, its genre and the movie's synopsis.

Here is a link to the app on Figma:

- Wireframes: https://www.figma.com/proto/EGtkDIDyaBj9zXDVSxTQWL/Wootlab?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down
- High-Fidelity Prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/EGtkDIDyaBj9zXDVSxTQWL/Wootlab?node-id=4%3A3124&scaling=min-zoom

As result of my processes which included paper sketches (can be seen in this repository), wireframes (Figma link above), high-fidelity designs (also in Figma link above) and then prototyping, I was not able to complete the full app's requirements (such as the user being able to watch embedded YouTube videos). In addition, I failed to create an exit strategy for the user through signing out.

A major issue I faced was recording the video using my MacBook's QuickTime which was a little bit problematic (probably due to my restricted understanding of its use). However, because I use Figma for both my Wireframing and Prototyping, what was missed out during my recording can be fully experienced online through Figma.

One feedback I have for the team is probably to focus more on the candidate's design thinking instead of just the UI - and I say this because it is quite difficult completing a Web and Mobile app design in less than a week if proper processes (such as research, ideation, sketches, low-fi, high-fi prototypes) are being duly followed. I would say this was my biggest challenge during this test (completing the task properly within the given time).

Thanks a lot for this opportunity.
